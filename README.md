# HotPacker
## CREDIT:
The code for the unpacker is a modified version of [BLiNXthetimesweepergod's HOT file unpacker](https://github.com/BLiNXthetimesweeperGOD/My-reverse-engineering-scripts/blob/main/packages/HOT.py), a lot of my reverse engineering was based off his code.

### Tools to pack (WIP) and unpack `.hot` files for the game `VOODOO VINCE: Remastered`

#### This project is still a WIP, the repacker doesn't work.
